## 🔍 Error Analysis

### Common Error Patterns

#### 1. Emotion Misalignment (40% of errors)

**Pattern**: Model generates responses with incorrect emotional tone

**Examples**:
- Saying "glad" for devastating situations
- Using generic positive phrases for negative emotions
- Missing intensity of emotions (devastated → neutral)

**Root Cause**: 
- Limited training data per emotion
- Simple emotion encoding (just a label, no semantic understanding)
- Model prioritizes fluency over emotional accuracy

---

#### 2. Context Drift (30% of errors)

**Pattern**: Model generates grammatically correct but contextually irrelevant responses

**Examples**:
- "going to the beach" when discussing a first date
- "what kind of cake" when discussing a concert
- "get a refund" at an auction

**Root Cause**:
- Attention mechanism not capturing long-range dependencies well
- Small model size (limited context window)
- Generic response generation tendency

---

#### 3. Generic Responses (20% of errors)

**Pattern**: Model generates safe, generic responses that work anywhere

**Examples**:
- "that's good"
- "i'm glad you had a great time"
- "that's awesome"

**Root Cause**:
- Training objective favors common patterns
- Limited model capacity to generate diverse responses
- Lack of diversity penalty in loss function

---

#### 4. Pronoun Confusion (10% of errors)

**Pattern**: Incorrect pronoun usage or reference

**Examples**:
- "i'm excited for her" (wedding - should be "for us")
- "he was so mad at him" (unclear referent)
- "happy for him" (when talking about speaker)

**Root Cause**:
- Coreference resolution challenges
- First-person vs third-person perspective confusion
- Limited training examples with clear pronoun usage
